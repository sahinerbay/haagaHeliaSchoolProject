									<p>Suomenlinna Fortress is also known as the Sveaborg, or Swedish Castle, and also as the Sea Fort because it occupies
										a cluster of small islands just outside of Helsinki, Finland. A relative latecomer to Scandinavia, Suomenlinna
										was built by the Swedes in response to the construction of Russia’s new capital at St. Petersburg, which posed
										a serious threat to Finland. It also served as a maritime base, and at its height boasted one of the largest and
										most modern shipyards in the world. Although it is no longer in military use, most of the fortress was restored
										over the last few decades, and over 800 Helsinki residents call Suomenlinna home. It is now the most popular tourist
