# School Project 

Render pages through Amica and Flicker API services.

## Getting Started

These instructions will get you a copy of the project up and running on your local machine for development and testing purposes. 

### Prerequisites

* You need to have node.js and npm installed in order to run this web application.

* If you're using OS X or Windows, the best way to install Node.js is to use one of the installers from the Node.js download page. 

    Check if node.js installed correctly;

    ```
    node -v
    ```

* Node comes with npm installed so you should have a version of npm. However, npm gets updated more frequently than Node does, so you'll want to make sure it's the latest version.

```
npm install npm@latest -g
```

### Installing

Install the required tools and configurations via npm.

```
npm install
```

And install Gulp.js globally

```
npm install -g gulp
```

End with an example of getting some data out of the system or using it for a little demo

## Deployment

Run gulpfile.js

```
gulp project:watch
```
